run `python main.py` to get the runtime graph
of the algorithms.

run `python test.py` to check both algorithms
return the same result.

`trie output test` and `naive output test` provide 
sample outputs for the first 20 tweets in the dataset

The algorithms are in `algorithm.py` and loading
data is done in `data.py`.

A sample output of the runtime graph is
`NaiveVsEfficient.png`.
